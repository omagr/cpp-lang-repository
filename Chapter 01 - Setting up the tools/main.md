C++ dev tools:
    
    1. Integrated development environment (IDE) or Code-Editor : is a piece of software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).
    : Visual Studio Code


    2. Compiler : is a piece of software that compiles the high level code into the binary executable format or low level code that directly run on the hardware.
    (installing multiple type of compilers to have a great chance to text code against them and increasing the chances to really be portable and work on multiple-compilers-operating-sysytem) -> c++,java,scala
    : Gcc - g++ --version
    : Msvc - cl.exe (x)
    : Clang llvm - clang++ --version

    3. Interpreter : is a piece of software that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. -> python,perl,ruby,JavaScript
    (installing multiple type of compilers to have a great chance to text code against them and increasing the chances to really be portable and work on multiple-compilers-operating-sysytem)
    : Gcc - g++ --version
    : Msvc - cl.exe (x)
    : Clang llvm - clang++ --version

    3. extensions :
    : c/c++ extension
