//** Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation. As compared to the vector, the list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick (constant time).
//# STL list is the implementation of doubly linked list Data Structure.
//# STL forward_list is the implementation of singly linked list Data Structure.
