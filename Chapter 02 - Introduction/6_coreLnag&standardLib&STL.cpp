    all those rules who say what to do pr what to not do with

    predefined datatypes

    these little thigs make up the raw ingredients you use to make a proper cpp program


c++ standard library's features:
it is a set of ready to uise highly specialized compoenents that we can use in our programs

    it tries to provide highly specialized components that we can use in regular prpogram

    one of them component is <iostream>

c++ STL's features:
it is really a part of the cpp standard library but it is a collection of container type think of them as collection of things and we have set of types that allows us to stoire collections, we have special alogrithimns and function that works on these collections and we have specialized types that are called iterators that allow us to navigate through these containers potenially running these algorithims on each elemnts in the collection
